# Java--BasicAddressBook

- It's basic address book system with fake database, user types, ui handler, contollers and manual test.
- I have tried to write code as generic as I could.
- I have tried keep coupling in the lowest level I could.
- I have divided part program into components.
- Database is not included, but created class and stored values in list. (FakeDatabase)


## Code Parts Explanation

- Person -> Person property classes
- User -> Person class with additional property which is address book list
- Fake Database -> This class has list for storing system users, it act as fake database
- Ui handler -> Class that developed to fulfill all the request from the front-end part
- User Controller ->  It's controller class with add, delete, diplay, update, get methods for system user manipulation
- Phone Book Person Controller -> It's controller class with add, delete, diplay, update, get methods for the address book manipulation that system users have

- Main.java -> Due to not using database in this project, I have created manual test class to check functionality


## How To Run
- Run Main class in ManualTestPackage to test the code out
